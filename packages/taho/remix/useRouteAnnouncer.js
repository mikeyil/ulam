/**
 * Announces route transitions to screen readers.
 * Mount once in your Remix root layout.
 *
 * Remix does not manage focus or announcements on client-side navigations.
 * This hook fills that gap by announcing when a navigation completes,
 * giving screen reader users the same awareness sighted users get from
 * visual page changes.
 *
 * @param {(pathname: string) => string} [getLabel]
 *   Override the announcement text. Defaults to announcing the new pathname.
 *   In practice, wire this to your page title:
 *     useRouteAnnouncer(pathname => document.title)
